    "description": "VR has been a part of my design workflow for years. As a visualization tool, it's been valuable for seeing objects and environments at their real scale while still existing only in a digital form. While the technology is still in a formative state, the graphical fidelity and accessibility of available hardware has made enormous progress in just the past few years. Simpler devices like the Meta Quest 2 prove that wide adoption of XR will be dependent on a great end-to-end UX. In my opinion, designers and developers haven't yet been able to justify putting on the headset to most casual users, and I'm continually experimenting and prototyping to try and find a great use of the technology. WebXR, Meta's App Lab, and AR on iOS are my preferred tools.",
